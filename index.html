      <h3>Why Foster?</h3>
      <p>
        Fostering helps pets adjust to home life and prepares them for adoption. 
        It gives animals a second chance and helps shelters save more lives. 
        Anyone with love and a little time can make a big difference!

    <h3>How to Adopt</h3>
    <p>
      Adopting a pet is simple! Visit your local shelter or rescue, meet the animals, and talk to the staff about the adoption process. 
      They will help you find the perfect match and guide you through the steps to bring your new friend home.
